# OopWithGandalf
Oop with Gandalf is a funny project to pratice Object-Oriented Programming in C# with a pseudo-Rpg game!  

Is a simple Game: We have 3 classes: the Heros, the Wizards and the Demons. All classes have others child classes were we can pratice the Inheritance concept ; 

All those classes has some proprietes witch defines the Characters of the storyline

When start running, the program will request the value of the "Power" 

This Power can be aplicated in Atack or Defense Methods, like in a Table RPG Game 

The storyline was based in Lord Of The Rings and Tolkien Universe. 

So, do you like? lets go improve these code together? ;)
