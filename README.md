# OopWithGandalf
Oop with Gandalf is a funny project to pratice Object-Oriented Programming in C# with a pseudo-Rpg game!  

It is a simple Game: We have 3 classes: the Heros, the Wizards and the Demons. All classes has others child classes where we can pratice the Inheritance concept;

All those classes has some proprietes witch defines the Characters of the storyline.

When start running, the program will request the value of the "Power". 

This Power can be applicable in Atack or Defense Methods, like in a Table RPG Game 

The storyline was based in the Lord Of The Rings and Tolkien Universe. 

So, did you like it? Let's go to improve these code together? ;)
